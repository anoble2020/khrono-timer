2. âœ… **Clean Check**: Ensures no uncommitted changes
3. âœ… **Version Bump**: Updates `package.json` with new version
4. âœ… **Tests**: Runs linting and build verification
5. âœ… **Commit**: Creates a release commit
6. âœ… **Push**: Pushes to `dev` branch (if using quick commands)
7. ðŸ“‹ **Instructions**: Shows next steps for creating PR

## Next Steps After Release Command

## Branch Management

## Troubleshooting

### Release Script Fails
- Check you're on `dev` branch: `git branch`
- Check for uncommitted changes: `git status`
- Run tests manually: `npm run lint && npm run build`

### Version Already Exists
- The script will prevent duplicate versions
- Use `--custom` to set a specific version
- Check existing versions: `git tag`

### Build Fails
- Check GitHub Actions logs
- Verify all dependencies are installed
- Test locally first: `npm run build`
